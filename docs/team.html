    <h3>Jamie Lombardi</h3>
    <p class="institution">Professor, Allegheny College</p>

    <div class="bio">
        <p> Jamie uses smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations and machine learning to model stellar collisions, especially in dense environments like galactic nuclei and star clusters. His work focuses on understanding collision outcomes and connecting them to astrophysical consequences such as stripped-star formation and the spin-orbit properties of binary black holes.

    <p class="institution">Joseph Cummings Professor, NU</p>

    <div class="bio">
        <p>Fred Rasio’s research spans a wide range of topics in theoretical astrophysics, including: exoplanets and planet formation; the dynamics of dense stellar systems; hydrodynamic stellar interactions; and relativistic astrophysics. His most recent work has focused on the dynamics of extrasolar planetary systems, gravitational wave sources for laser-interferometer detectors, and the formation of massive black holes through stellar dynamical processes.</p>

    <h3>Charles F.A. Gibson</h3>
    <p class="institution">Graduate Student, NU</p>

    <div class="bio">
        <p>Charlie's research lies at the intersection of stellar evolution and the hydrodynamical evolution of stellar collision products. His work bridges the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code StarSmasher, used to model stellar collisions, and the stellar evolution code MESA, enabling a better understanding of how stellar collisions and interactions shape both the short-term and long-term structure and evolution of stars.</p>
